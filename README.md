# README Generator

## Description
I created this README generator program so that users can quickly and easily make a professional README.md file for their various repositories. I did this to help save users time when creating their README's and quickly move on to other aspects of their projects.

## Table of Contents
- [Installation](#installation)
- [Usage](#usage)
- [License](#license)
- [Contributing](#contributing)
- [Tests](#tests)
- [Questions](#questions)

## Installation
N/A

## Usage
To use, you simply open your terminal and type node index.js using the correct pathway to the file. You will then be prompted by a series of questions to answer regarding your README. After you finish answering all questions a README file will be automatically generated! It will include a license badge of your selected license at the top as well as a table of contents with links to the variouus sections. It will also create links for your GitHub profile and email address under the questions section.
